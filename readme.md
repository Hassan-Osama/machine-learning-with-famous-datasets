# Machine Learning Projects on Famous Datasets 

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects built on some of the most well-known datasets in the data science and ML community.

Each project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation and comparison
- Ensemble and stacking techniques (when applicable)
